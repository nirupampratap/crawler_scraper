# crawler_scraper
Crawl and Scrape any Website you choose

Built this Python notebook to show the easiness with which you can write a crawler and Scraper in Python. We use BeautifulSoup to extract text blobs from websites of our choosing. This is a very simple but powerful notebook. I hope you find it useful as well.

* This notebook crawls and scrapes a popular Telugu daily Eenadu.net
* Notebook should be modified to custom suit the crawl requirements of individual websites (i.e. based on link structures)
* Notebook provides code to download image files (you can easily extend this to video files as well)
* Notebook stores the crawled text in a json file. Provides the ability to link text to urls
* Notebook does not handle Captchas. Throttle the requests to not run into captchas. Else integrate with a Captcha decoder to auto answer captchas (this is work for a later date)

Happy crawling!!!


P.S.: In case you find any bugs or extensions feel free to write to me.
